# Virtual-Memory-Paging
In this project, we will emulate two virtual memory management schemes to manage the interactions between physical memory and the virtual memory by mapping a subset of the virtual memory pages to the available physical pages.

This project requires us to construct two page replacement algorithms to manage the limited physical memory. They are:

First In First Out Replacement (FIFO)

Clock Replacement (Second Chance)
